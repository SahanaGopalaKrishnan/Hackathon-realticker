🚀 RealTicker – AI-Powered Stock Insights Platform

RealTicker is a full-stack web application developed as part of a hackathon project. It helps users explore stock trends through interactive charts and provides basic AI-assisted insights to support understanding of market movement.

The application uses a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, with optional HuggingFace integration for generating analysis. Mock data is included so the project can run completely offline for demo purposes.
